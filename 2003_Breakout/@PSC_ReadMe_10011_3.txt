Title: Armond's Breakout
Description: This game is an imitation of the classic "Breakout." The source code written and the GUI was developed on the Borland Builder IDE. I tried to make the game as interesting as possible so I added scoring, points, misses, etc. When you lose the game and if you have enough credits, you can purchase a new life by using up your score. The game is packed with 100 levels with every 5th level being a new theme. You start off in Egypt near the Great Pyramid. After completing all 100 levels, ( if qualified ), you will be inducted into the Hall of Fame.
